# parking-lot-project
A project in which I plan to make a parking lot supervising aplication.
Here are few steps I will try to accomplish:
Create an app which uses SQLite to keep track of everything inside
Primary function is to create a parking lot with the number of parking spaces
Next functions should assign cars to spots
Next should remove cars form assignment
Next should change the number plate of an assigned car
Next should give out a list of all cars assigned to specific parking spot
